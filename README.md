Student Mark Analysis

ðŸ”¹Project Overview

This project analyzes student performance using a dataset containing scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, along with demographic and family-related features. The goal is to identify patterns affecting academic performance and build predictive models to estimate math scores.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values
Converted categorical features for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of scores by gender, ethnic group, and lunch type
Box plots & scatter plots to study relationships (siblings, first child, etc.)
Statistical summaries of student performance

Machine Learning Model
Built a Linear Regression model to predict Math scores based on Reading & Writing scores
Achieved an RÂ² Score to measure model accuracy

Visualizations

Count plots, box plots, scatter plots, and bar plots
Insights into how gender, lunch type, and family factors influence performance

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
GitHub for version control and sharing
